The annual Barcamp battambong has strike the scene once again on 3th-4th August 2019, the venue held in the University of Battambong. Under the theme “ Technology and Entrepreneurship “ alongside the Career Fair and the organizer team did a great job in bringing this event come to life.

As a tech-company, KOOMPI join in with an exhibition to demonstrate and showcase our product line. We hosted the Power of Coding initiatives and get the participants to explore also to understand more about the computing and programming world. 

Just as the interesting theme this year “ Technology and Entrepreneurship “, we have seen a lot of IT-enthusiastics and entrepreneur-wannabe that come to learn and wish to refine themselves more in study as well as their career in this open-forum platform. 

During the Power of Coding session, we manage to form an IT community-based in Battambong out of our participants. They are mostly an IT students and passionately willing to join us after hearing about our mission and the ultimate goal we wish to accomplish. 

We appreciated the effort of Barcamp team that successfully organized such a buzz and amazing event to happen. Drivin by our mission, to provide the tools necessary for the next generation of engineers, problem solvers, and discoverers. KOOMPI will strongly stay collaborate and engage more people toward the era of programming and technology wishing to make technology more accessible for everyone.
