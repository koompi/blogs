# Pi IoT or PiotOS

The aim of this project is to build a router with network storage. Imagine a RasberryPi router with giant storage capacity and connect directly with ISP at your house. 

Except that the PiotOS will be running on a KOOMPI Mini type of hardware, which make it more powerful. 

While it works like a router to serve internet at home or at work, it can also serve as a node for decentralize storage of data and other transactions validator. Making money for the owner/user.


We will benchmark the OS from [RIOT OS](https://riot-os.org/#features). 

The other idea of development will be updating accordingly. This is our pre-stage concept. Won't start developing yet.
