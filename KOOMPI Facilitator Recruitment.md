We want facilitators! And yes we mean what we just said. As we already mentioned since the early days from when we launched KOOMPI, what keeps us passionately do all the things we do now was our bold mission. Driven by our mission, we aim to build a strong army next generation of engineers, problem solvers, and discoverers. 

We ambitiously dream of equipping every high school from Cambodia with KOOMPI laptop that already programs with education content and programming languages to inspire the next generation to be the super-user. To accomplish that, we need a facilitator who needs to assist and support the activities within the computer lab located in every school. We call all of this as “ KOOMPI STEAM “ https://medium.com/koompi/koompi-steam-project-initiative-7ebd6e02b741

Our trained facilitators will assist students to develop their self-guided computer coursework, which will compliment smoothly and work autonomously alongside our present-day Khmer curriculum. Besides, facilitators will train local assistants, sharing our self-guided lessons with all teachers and community members who express interest.

Currently, working with a few private and public schools KOOMPI managed to installed our laptop in the computer lab, which will become a necessary tool for the students. Now, we shout out to looking for potential individuals who eventually sharing the same passion with us in synergy to make it work. 

But don’t get confused! We don’t look for experience one, the talented people or the high education individuals but we want to see the passionate, genuine and humble mind who is willing to join the mission and prosper together.

We are all sharing the same dream, boiling to make those wildest dreams happen but we alone “ few people “ can’t make it successfully happen. At first, we might sound like just a based-less fiction that shout imagination but now little pieces from the dream become a reality. Gearing our hopes up, we moving alongside our ultimate goal now.

We don’t promise and we hate promising anything, we don’t promise tangible benefit or materials things but we never take people for granted. We believe in people's hard work and willing to give what they deserved.
