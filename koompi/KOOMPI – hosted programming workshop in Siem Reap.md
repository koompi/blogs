KOOMPI – hosted programming workshop in Siem Reap


On 12th July, we going to Siem Reap Province, where we hosted a short programming course called “ Arduino Programming course “ in collaboration with the Cambot team and Australian Pacific International ( API ) School. 

The course was designed with KOOMPI as a tool, hence The Cambot team playing an instructor role and genuinely guide and explain all the details needed for the students.   

We impress with how the young students involved passionately taking their time learning from us; learn how the actual robot move; learn how programming make a change fascinately before their very eyes. 

KOOMPI team decide to keep it as a monthly workshop and do it in partnership with API school and continue to expand it to other private/public schools shortly.

Hopefully, with our mission to build the necessary tool for the next generation of engineers, problem solvers, and discoverers it would become an inspiring story to attract potential people to come to join hands with us and make the dream became a reality.
