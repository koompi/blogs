KOOMPI - Our Story

KOOMPI began with the dream of bringing knowledge and inspiration through technology to the builders and creators of tomorrow.

Chosen to be the symbol of knowledge and self-empowerment, the word KOOMPI is derive from the Khmer phrase meaning "the Books or Source of Knowledge".

Since times of the early Khmer empire, a young man would go to live at the Buddhist monastery to read, study, grow and prepare for adulthood.

All the books this young man was given to use and learn from were simply called KOOMPI.

Today ancient learning materials have been transformed by technology, and therefore we have the new KOOMPI.

The KOOMPI project has a bold mission.

We aim to assemble, fine tune and provide for our youths a comprehensive stack of modern learning applications to empower the next generation of engineers, problem solvers and discoverers.

KOOMPI branded hardware is specifically designed to work together in synergy with our own PIONUX branded software.

KOOMPI hardware together with PIONUX software (derived from PIONeer liNUX) is the tool both advanced and beginner students need to move beyond the stage of an ordinary user.

With the evolution of modern computers, there are those who are empowered with full control over the technology they hold, then there are those who are controlled by that same technology.

The KOOMPI is not just another notebook computer.

We're building a serious learning and productivity tool designed to empower users through knowledge, as a notebook of knowledge, as our name implies.

The KOOMPI is a spinoff of a computer recycing and reuse program together with www.recycles.org

Early on in our formative years, various businesses, NGOs and individuals began to donate their old hardware to SmallWorld so in turn we could refurbish the hardware and grant it to serious students unable to afford any computer at all.

We understood then how a customized Linux system would run lightning fast on this older technology, yet still provide all the power and convenience of a new MicroSoft or Apple system.

The KOOMPI core team of developers is aligned with the heart of our nation and the world, working each day to provide the products and services you need to face tomorrow with confidence.
