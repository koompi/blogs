The launching of " Young Scientist Club "

On 17th August 2019, we embarked on the journey by signing a Partnership Agreement between KOOMPI and a private school, Westline Education Group means to officially launch the “ Young Scientist Club “. 

The concept of the Young Scientist Club was designed to be the social learning model aiming to inspire and encourage young students to be the discoverers, problem solvers and the creator of tomorrow. 

This is by far, our first pilot school which KOOMPI set out to equip 30 laptops to create the so-called, KOOMPI STEAM, now we call “ KOOMPI Social Learning “. 

Moving forward, with the passionately support from Westline Group in collaboration with the KOOMPI team, hoping to produce an even younger aspiring mind that would contribute to producing fruitful results in the far future.

Hosted by KOOMPI, which the facility was provided in one of the Westline Group, Dunh Penh branch, Young Scientist Club will operate with the guidance by the facilitator who will assist the students to develop their self-guided learning curriculum. 

Since this is just the beginning of the journey, we hope it is just the first step but not the least. Still, we are looking forward to recruiting more facilitators whose ability to think critically, to use technology in imaginative and creative ways to solve real-world problems. Interested candidate can apply through our official telegram group: t.me/koompi. 

Finally, this is something we are looking forward since the inception of KOOMPI, hope that it created positive remarks and attract all schools around the country to work with us and then share the opportunity with the young generation in the next years to come. ~ KOOMPI TEAM ~
